Electromechanical diagrams
====

This directory contains our schematic diagrams in form PNG of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other. We used cirkitdesigner instead of tinkercad as tinkercad didn't have the mega board that we used.
